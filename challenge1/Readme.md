Prerequisites:

Install Terraform: Make sure you have Terraform installed on your local machine.
AWS Account: You'll need an AWS account with appropriate permissions to create resources.

Step 1: AWS Provider Configuration
Create a new directory for your Terraform configuration and create a file named main.tf.

Step 2: Presentation Tier
In this tier, we will set up an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to handle incoming traffic and distribute it to the Application Tier instances.

Step 3: Application Tier
In this tier, we will set up EC2 instances to host our application. In a real-world scenario, you may use an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) to automatically manage the instances, but for simplicity, we will set up a single EC2 instance.

Step 4: Database Tier
In this tier, we will set up an RDS (Relational Database Service) instance to host our database.

Step 5: Deploying the Infrastructure
Open a terminal in the directory containing your Terraform files and run the following commands:
1. terraform init
2. terraform plan
3. terraform apply
